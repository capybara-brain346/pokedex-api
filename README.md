# Pokedex-API

## Demo Video üìΩÔ∏è: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXXRnLPZq_8

This project is a RESTful API developed with FastAPI that provides detailed data on over 1,000 Pok√©mon. It allows users to query various Pok√©mon attributes such as name, species, abilities, type, and combat stats. The API integrates a PostgreSQL database to store and manage Pok√©mon data scraped from external sources.

## Features
- **Comprehensive Pok√©mon Data:**
  - Data scraped from [pokemondb.net](https://pokemondb.net) for 1,015 Pok√©mon.
  - Data stored in CSV files and imported into a PostgreSQL database for persistence.
  - Uploaded to Kaggle as an open-source dataset, receiving over 1,100 downloads and 5,000 views.

- **API Endpoints:**
  - Query Pok√©mon by different attributes such as name, abilities, type, size, species, growth rate, catch rate, friendship, and experience.

- **Automated Workflows:**
  - GitHub Actions configured for Continuous Integration (CI) to automate linting with Pylint and building the application inside a container.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** Core programming language for developing the API and scraping Pok√©mon data.
- **FastAPI:** Framework used to build the RESTful API server.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for storing Pok√©mon data.
- **Scrapy:** For scraping Pok√©mon data from external sources.
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates linting and container builds.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about:
- Pok√©mon Name
- Species
- Type(s)
- Abilities
- Base Stats (HP, Attack, Defense, etc.)
- Size (Height, Weight)
- Growth Rate
- Catch Rate
- Base Friendship
- Base Experience

The dataset has been uploaded on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crinklybrain2003/pokmon-base-stats-dataset).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/capybara-brain346/pokedex-api.git
   cd pokedex-api
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the FastAPI server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

5. **Access the API:**
   - Once the server is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to access the API.
   - Use the interactive API documentation provided by FastAPI at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

## Docker

To run the API using Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t pokedex-api .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 pokedex-api
   ```

3. **Access the API:**
   - Once the container is running, navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to access the API.

## API Endpoints

### Pok√©mon Attributes

- **GET /pokemons/name/{name}:**  
  Fetch Pok√©mon data by name.
  
- **GET /pokemons/abilities/{abilities}:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by their abilities.

- **GET /pokemons/type/{pokemon_type}:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by their type (e.g., Water, Fire, etc.).

- **GET /pokemons/size:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by size (height and/or weight). Pass values like `>2.5` for height or `<=50` for weight.

- **GET /pokemons/species/{pokemon_species}:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by species.

- **GET /pokemons/growth_rate/{pokemon_growth_rate}:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by growth rate (e.g., Fast, Slow).

- **GET /pokemons/catch_rate:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by catch rate. Pass values like `>=45`.

- **GET /pokemons/base_friendship:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by base friendship. Pass values like `>=50`.

- **GET /pokemons/base_experience:**  
  Query Pok√©mon by base experience. Pass values like `>=100`.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The project utilizes GitHub Actions for automating:
- **Linting:** Pylint is used to maintain code quality.
- **Containerization:** GitHub Actions automatically builds the app inside a container for deployment.

## Future Improvements

- Add more nuanced filtering options (e.g., multi-type filtering, ability combinations).
- Implement caching for frequently queried data to improve response time.
- Add support for more detailed Pok√©mon statistics and movesets.
